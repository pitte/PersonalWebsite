    <h1 style="color:#E6E6E6; font-family: Arial Unicode MS">Hello!</h1>
<p>
I am a creative problem solver who uses programming as a tool. Graduated from Link√∂ping School of Technology in september 2013 with a Bachelor in Computer Science. 
</p>

<p>
During my Computer Science studies I focused on Software Development. I have taken courses in: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Advanced Programming on the WWW - wrote a simple Forum using GWT Widgets. Languages: Java, SQLite</li>
<li>Computer Graphics - wrote 3D software using OpenGL, we programmed our own Shaders in GLSL</li>
<li>Database Technology - SQL (MySQL, SQLite)</li>
<li>Data Structures and Algorithms - QuickSort, Queues and Trees</li>
<li>Design Patterns - UML Diagrams</li>
<li>Linear Algebra - 3D math</li>
<li>Object Oriented Programming - C++ Focus</li>
</ul>

<p>The languages most commonly used was C, C++ and Java. We programmed mainly in an Emacs and Eclipse environment in the Linux operating system so I broadened my skillset and tried web development with .NET at home. I enjoy writing software; it is always fun to start out with a detailed schematic and plan how you will proceed with writing the software. 
</p>

<p>
    My final thesis is about the differences and similarities between programming with a visual programming tool in the Unreal 3 game engine and traditional programming. During school we programmed by writing text, with this visual tool you programmed by connecting nodes together which I found very interesting.

<p>Thanks,<br />
