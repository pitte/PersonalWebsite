This is my first game, developed with the UDK. It's a sci-fi adventure game with a exploring and puzzle solving focus. Almost all of the assets used came with the engine; i.e. they're from Unreal Tournament 3. 
I also relied heavily on BSP brushes for geometry and buildings. I have written all the music for the game. 
My ambition is to make it into a survival horror game later on but it's on hiatus now.
